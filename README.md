# MadClowns Mod Series for Factorio.
The official MadClown01's mods for Factorio, as maintained by Pezzawinkle on behalf of MadClown01.

## Madclowns Vanilla Nuclear
Introduces a multi-step enrichment process to replace the Koravex process with something a bit more fun. The multi-step enrichment allows the separation of LEU (low enrichment Uranium) and WGU (weapons grade Uranium) to be made separately.
Also adds Plutonium recovery and usage in a MOX fuel cell (higher production of regular fuel).
Adds an alternative recipe for an atomic bomb using Plutonium and a larger radius thermonuclear bomb. (These can do serious damage, even to massive health biters like bobs Leviathans).
Optional (off by default) is nuclear/thermonuclear artillery shells.
Stand well back!

## Madclowns Processing
### This is an extension of angels petrochem and smelting, which works in special vanilla mode.
- Introduces new materials: Mercury, Osmium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, a multi-step uranium ore processing system (angels smelting style) and Depleted Uranium processing.
- Introduces sand sluicing for extra materials (similar to, but less efficient than mineral sludge processing for some advanced ores)
- Neurotoxin production
- Adds 2 new tiers of faster centrifuges
- Re-organises armour and equipment into its own group (setting can be turned off)
- Fluorine gas production
- Catalytic electrolysis/flitering (for pure output, not mixed, such as Oxygen from air)
### Angels Bioprocessing
 - Adds a new phosphoric acid based fertiliser recipe
 - Adds a different style of garden mutation
 - mercury from algae farming (alternative to getting it from thermal water)
Fully supports (as was originally written to work with) bobs mods.
